# react-drag-and-drop-dnd-kit
This project demonstrates a drag-and-drop implementation in React using the @dnd-kit/core library. It mimics the functionality of a Jira-like board, where items (e.g., tasks or tickets) can be dragged and dropped between multiple containers. The implementation is lightweight, customizable, and supports touch devices out of the box.
